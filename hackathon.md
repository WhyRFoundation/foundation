### Data visualization tools - Workshops

On an evening before the hackathon, we plan a small session of free workshops related to data visualization tools

Shiny, python Dash, d3.js, Tableau, PowerBI, ggplot2, Excel options, Adobe photoshop/illustrator.

It's a chance to acknowledge a new tool and compare to the ones you already know.

### Challenges

During the hackathon, participants of Why R? conference together work on tasks related to data science. The core goal is to use data visualization techniques to
solve a Real Life Problem. There is also a side track, meant to boost the competition, which is the Fix my Chart track. Teams can participate in both Tracks at the same time.

This year there are 2 Tracks on the hackathon.

|Fix my Chart  | Real Life Problem |
|:-------------|------------------:|
| - The focal point is to improve existing data visualizations.  <br> - Participants work together in small groups and can reach out to mentors for immediate feedback. <br> - At the end of the event, all projects are concluded during the voting (separately for mentors and participants) for the best chart produced during the event. <br> - There is also a leader-board calculated online for the propositions submitted live, during the event, which can boost the competition!| To Be Annouanced |
