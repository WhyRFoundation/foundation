# Financial and Legal support

The initial goal of Why R? Foundation was to establish a legal identity capable of cooperation with companies and institutions. Why R? Foundation possesses its own bank account and a professional accountant who is experienced in accounting settlements for non-government organizations hosting conferences and community events.

Our previous achievements (four editions of the Why R? Conference, SatRday Gdańsk 2019, four hackathons, almost 30 pre-meetings and similar events) prove we were capable of successfully overseeing the operational and financial aspects of organized events. 

Thanks to the variety of connections in academia and industry, Why R? Foundation managed to acquire and maintain relationships with a large number of sponsors. Our legal status allows us to be more flexible in contract arrangements with potential sponsors and academic institutions.
