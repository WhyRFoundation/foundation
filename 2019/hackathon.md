### Why data visualizations?

Nowadays data has become an invaluable resource where those who can transform data into meaningful information are the ones to make a difference in business and society. Making sense of data has become a matter of success and failure for companies and organizations around the world. It has also become one of the most needed skills on the labour market.<br>

Being an expert in data visualization is considered as one of the most desired skills when dealing with the complexity of data and the challenge of information design. The data science community acknowledges that extracting insights from data does not only require skills in statistical modeling but also an ability to effectively visualize information.<br>

### Why Hackathon?

Hackathons are events where enthusiasts of a specific topic gather in one place to work together on challenges that arose for a particular community.<br>

Hackathons tend to be timepressure events, where solutions need to be created quicky and  active cooperation between participants is necessary. To set the pace of the event, participants are divided into teams which compete to prepare the most valuable solution and win a prize. <br>

For a participant such an undertaking is a great chance to: <br>

<ul>
<li>develop the ability to work in group</li>
<li>learn from more experienced practitioners</li>
<li>take part in lectures and workshops related to data visualization</li>
<li>have a remarkable networking experience</li>
<li>participate in healthy and fair competition</li>

### The challenge

Mordor by day, banks of Vistula by night. 
Let's find out which areas citizens of Warsaw visit most frequently! 
In this hackathon, we will track the behaviour of people based on the GCP data

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) enables 6 APIs that provide information about maps, traffic, routes or places around the globe. We decided to use GCP APIs to prepare a data set of places in Warsaw with the information about its type, address and geographical localization; where rating, number or reviews and occupancy (popular times per day) were taken from Google Search Engine!

Having such an interesting data one can immediately think about potential use cases! 

- What is the best place to make a new advertisement in the city? 
- What are the blank spaces on the map where a specific service is missing? 
- Are the most crowded places properly equipped with a sufficient amount of city bike stations? What are the - moving/traffic trends throughout the day? 
- Does the occupancy of the areas correspond to the real estate prices?

Imagine other use cases you can invent, the moment you link the data with other sources.

### Competition Rules

Since the event is a competition with symbolic prices, we would like to grade solutions.
It should be an innovative presentation of data that uses data visualization techniques to show interesting insights based on the Popular Times for Places data set.
