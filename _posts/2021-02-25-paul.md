On Thursday, February 25th at 7 pm UTC | 8 pm CET, as part of the Why R? Webinar series, we have the honour to host 
[Paul Bürkner](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/about/), Junior Research Group Leader at the Cluster of Excellence SimTech
at the University of Stuttgart (Germany). Author of the R package **brms** and member of the Stan Development Team, Paul
will explain how the R package provides an interface to fit Bayesian generalized (non-)linear multivariate multilevel 
models using [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), a C++ package for performing full Bayesian inference.

Join us!

### Talk

#### Speaker
- [Paul Bürkner](https://github.com/paul-buerkner)
  <br> Paul is a statistician currently working as an Independent Junior Research Group Leader at the Cluster of 
  Excellence SimTech at the University of Stuttgart (Germany). He is the author of the R package **[brms](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms)**
  and member of the Stan Development Team. Previously, he studied Psychology and Mathematics at the Universities of 
  Münster and Hagen (Germany) and did his PhD in Münster about optimal design and Bayesian data analysis. Paul has also 
  worked as a Postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science at Aalto University (Finland).

#### **brms**: Bayesian Regression Models using Stan
The **brms** package provides an interface to fit Bayesian generalized (non-)linear multivariate multilevel models using
[Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), a C++ package for performing full Bayesian inference. The formula syntax is very 
similar to that of the **lme4** package to provide a familiar and simple interface for performing regression analyses. A
wide range of response distributions are supported, allowing users to fit – among others – linear, robust linear, count 
data, survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, and even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context.
Further modeling options include non-linear and smooth terms, auto-correlation structures, censored data, missing value 
imputation, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the response distribution can be predicted in order to 
perform distributional regression. Multivariate models, i.e., models with multiple response variables, can be fit as well.
Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that reflect their beliefs.
Model fits can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive checks, cross-validation, and Bayes factors.
