<img src="http://whyr.pl/2020/img/whyr2020/meetings.jpg" class="fit image"> Why R? pre-meetings are R meetups that support local R communities. Their main goal is to promote [Why R? 2020 Conference](http://whyr.pl/2020/) that will be held between 27-30 August in Warsaw (Poland, Europe).

Another purpose of those meetings is to provide space for the professional networking and knowledge exchange for practitioners and students from the areas of statistical machine learning, programming, optimization and data science.

Looking back, over last 3 years we have managed to co-organize 30 R and Data Science meetups around Central-Eastern Europe, among others in Warsaw, Prague, Berlin, Amsterdam, TriCity, Copenhagen or Wroclaw. We often provide beverages and pizza, cover transportation and accomodation costs for speakers and pay for the after party. Such meetings are a great opportunity to understand the needs and areas of interest of R users around Europe and globe! **In 2019 we managed to organize a meeting in Yerevan (Armenia, Asia) and were pleased to see local R group in Bauchi (Nigeria, Africa) was kind enough to organize Why R? pre-meeting in their city.**

*Those meetings would not happen without the help of local R hosts who have invested a lot of time and energy in this project!*

> We would like to keep supporting meetings in areas that have limited access to business supporters and sponsors.

If you want to organize an R meetup in your city and you are looking for the support to cover the costs of snacks or transport for speakers, you should contact us via kontakt_at_whyr.pl. We would be more than delighted to suggest the potential use cases for presentations, share ideas for the networking and help to find speakers in your close region.
