####  Data Optimisation Network
The Data Optimisation Network (DON) seeks to improve business decision-making using machine intelligence and data science
techniques. It predicts customer behaviour through data-driven insights to enable the business to acquire new customers
intelligently. The key problem with most of the companies is not just to acquire more customers, but it is to acquire the
right customers and retain them. Companies consider the cost of customer acquisition as an important measure in 
evaluating how much value a customer will bring to their businesses. DON will empower teams such as Customer Value 
Management, Marketing, Sales, Continuous Improvement and more via interactive dashboards available in real-time. 
These dashboards will enable research, and the understanding of market trends and behaviours. The demonstration of the 
app is based on the utility sector. However, the data is anonymised for the solution but depicts the real-life problem.
