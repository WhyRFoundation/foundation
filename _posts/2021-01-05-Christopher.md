### Talk description  

#### Innovative open-source approaches to automating research data management: Integrating Rshiny and REDCap

Data management for multi-center cohort studies is challenging especially for sites or centers that are geographically dispersed and have varying technical and manpower capacity. Moreover, in most setups, data management workflow is quite repetitive and in order to achieve efficiency, automation of these workflows becomes the key to getting real time data health checks and report authoring. I will present a basic framework for developing Rshiny applications and integrating them with research databases (REDCap and RDBMS)as a better alternative method for automating data management.
