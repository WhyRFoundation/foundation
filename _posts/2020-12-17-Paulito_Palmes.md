### Talk description  

#### JuliaR: combining Julia and R utilities and workflows to solve problems

Julia's main design is for HPC (high-performance computing) while R’s original design is meant for statistical computing. With huge amount of data becoming a norm nowadays, having both features are ideal to attack problems related to data science and machine learning. This talk will demonstrate how Julia and R features and packages can be used as complementary utilities to solve real problems. The approach adapts the unix pipeline workflow of solving problems by stitching together a set of small utilities from JuliaR that when combined in a certain way becomes an optimal solution to the problem. These small utilities if properly designed encourages reusability, seamless integration of Julia and R utils, and easy explainability of the entire workflow.
