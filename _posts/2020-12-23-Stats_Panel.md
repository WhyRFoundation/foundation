<img src="/foundation/images/fulls/whyr2020/panels/stat.jpg" class="fit image"> Three months ago we finished [Why R? 2020](http://2020.whyr.pl/) conference. The highlights of the conference were Discussion Panels! Today we would like to remind you about the Statistical Misconceptions panel. The video from the recording is at the end of the post.

From Excel spreadsheets to R scripts, data analysis is everywhere. However, its popularity results in many cases of serious misuse. Inflation bias (‘p-hacking’) and incorrect feature engineering (e.g., categorization of continuous variables) are among many potential traps that are often perceived as the proper way to analyze data. During this Discussion Panel [Frank Harrell](https://twitter.com/f2harrell), [Olga Vitek](https://twitter.com/olgavitek), [Małgorzata Bogdan](http://www.math.uni.wroc.pl/~mbogdan/) and [Jarek Harezlak](https://twitter.com/JarekHarezlak) shed some light on common statistical mistakes.
