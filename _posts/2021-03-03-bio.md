On Friday, March 5th at 4:30 pm UTC, R-Ladies Tunis are about to organize a workshop **Connecting Bioconductor to other bioinformatics tools using Rcwl** by Dr. Qian Liu.

More information below! Event on [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-tunis/events/276640797).

e are delighted to get back to the R4Bioinfo series that we've launched in September 2020. We will be organizing a new workshop about connecting Bioconductor to other bioinformatics tools using Rcwl: Application in sc-RNAseqdata.

Date/Time: Saturday, March 5, 2021 from 5:30 PM to 7:45 PM (GMT+1)

Place: Zoom https://zoom.us/download

# Speaker Dr. Qian Liu

Dr. Qian Liu joined the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics faculty at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center as an Assistant Professor of Oncology in October 2019. Prior to that, she was a post-doc affiliate supervised by Dr. Martin Morgan, in the Bioconductor Core Team. She has earned her PhD in Biostatistics, Master in Biostistics, and Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, and BA in BioEngineering. Dr. Liu is currently a CTSI scholar funded by the Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC) Scholar Program.

The workshop (https://liubuntu.github.io/Bioc2020RCWL/) will use real scRNA-seq data to demonstrate the usage of Rcwl and RcwlPipelines in doing the pre-processing and touch some downstream statistical analysis of scRNA-seq data.
