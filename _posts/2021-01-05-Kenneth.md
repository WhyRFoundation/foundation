<img src="/foundation/images/fulls/whyr2020/high/ken.jpg" class="fit image"> Three months ago we finished [Why R? 2020](http://2020.whyr.pl/) conference. One of the memorable moments of the conference were invited highlighted talks! Today we would like to remind you about the talk by [Kenneth Benoit](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Academic-Staff/Kenneth-Benoit/Kenneth-Benoit) (from London School of Economics). The video from the recording is at the end of the post.

The text analysis package quanteda is now a mature package with a large user base, and interwoven with a growing family of related packages for machine learning, text conversion, part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing, and sentiment analysis. I outline the reasons why you should be using it and what it can do for your natural language processing and text analysis needs.
