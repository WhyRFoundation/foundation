On Thursday, January 14th at 7 pm UTC, as part of the Why R? Webinar series, we had the honour to host 
[Susan Holmes](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/) from Stanford University. She did talk about **microbiomes** and
how to use R's workflow to perform sophisticated downstream statistical analysis on those complex bacterial communities.

Join us!

### Talk

#### Speaker
- [Susan Holmes](https://twitter.com/sherlockpholmes)
    Author of "Modern Statistics for Biology", Susan is a Professor of Statistics and member of BioX, Stanford University.
  She uses computational statistics to draw inferences about many complex biological phenomena, interactions between the 
  immune system and cancer, resilience and biomarker detection in the human microbiome and drug resistance in HIV. She 
  enjoys teaching using R and BioConductor and tries to make everything she does freely available.


#### Why using R for analysis of the human microbiome is a good idea
High-throughput sequencing of PCR-amplified taxonomic markers (like the 16S rRNA gene) has enabled a new level of 
analysis of complex bacterial communities known as microbiomes. Many tools exist to quantify and compare abundance 
levels or composition of bacterial communities in different conditions. The sequencing reads have to be denoised and 
assigned to microbiomes the closest taxa from a reference database. By providing a complete workflow in R, we enable the
user to do sophisticated downstream statistical analyses, whether parametric or nonparametric.

We provide examples of using the R packages `dada2`, `phyloseq`, `DESeq2`, `ggplot2`, `structSSI` and `vegan` to filter,
visualize and test microbiome data. We also provide examples of supervised analyses using random forests and 
nonparametric testing using community networks and the `ggnetwork` and `ggraph` packages.
