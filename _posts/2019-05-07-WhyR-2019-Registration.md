<img src="/foundation/images/fulls/whyr2019/tlosptronam_small.jpg" class="fit image"> Two editions of [Why R?](http://whyr.pl/) conferences were a great networking success. During each edition, we gathered around 200-300 R enthusiasts from Europe and we managed to carry out more than 25 workshops. Desire for a bigger event led us to the 3rd edition!

# About **Why R? 2019** conference

We are more than happy to announce that Why R? 2019 Conference will be organized by [Why R? Foundation](http://whyr.pl/foundation/tags/#info). The third official meeting of Polish R enthusiasts will be held in Warsaw from the 26th to the 29th of September 2019. Since English is the official language of the meeting, we would love to invite R users from other countries.

If you have doubts about visiting the upcoming event, you can discover photos and presentations from the previous ones and make sure whether you are interested. There are still few meetings that may be organized and are not yet added to the map. If you are interested in co-organizing a Why R? pre-meeting in your city, let us know (via kontakt_at_whyr.pl). The [Why R? Foundation](http://whyr.pl/foundation/#blog) can help you search for the speakers!
