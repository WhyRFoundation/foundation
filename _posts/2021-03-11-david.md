  <br> Founder of ArData, a French company providing R expertise, R training and consulting in data 
  sciences. He is the author of R packages, most popular are officer, flextable, rvg and ggiraph. He is a data scientist

Tables, just like graphs, can be a very good way to provide synthetic and clear information. The flextable package 
offers a flexible and rich syntax allowing the construction and formatting of static tables from R, these tables can be
integrated into HTML, Word, PDF and PowerPoint documents when using R Markdown and into Word and PowerPoint documents 
with package officer. In this talk, learn about the features of the package and the main principles, what are the latest
advances, how the package is maintained and possible new features.
