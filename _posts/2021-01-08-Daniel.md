<img src="/foundation/images/fulls/whyr2020/high/daniel.jpg" class="fit image"> Three months ago we finished [Why R? 2020](http://2020.whyr.pl/) conference. One of the memorable moments of the conference were invited highlighted talks! Today we would like to remind you about the talk by [Daniel Aleman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielalemanh/) (from Global BPM at Archroma). The video from the recording is at the end of the post.

Usually Data Scientist focus on: Which language? Package? Type of problem to solve? Technique to apply? What metrics to validate the model etc.. but my own experience and studies have shown that people(the final users) are distrustful of automated model for forecasting. In this presentation, I will not only share my experience using different techniques to have the best forecast analysis, but will disclose the journey to gain the trust of business over the project.
