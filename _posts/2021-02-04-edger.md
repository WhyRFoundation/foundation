On Saturday, February 6th at 9 am UTC, R-Ladies Tunis are about to organize a workshop **RNA-seq analysis is easy as 1-2-3 with limma, Glimma and edgeR** by [Xueyi Dong]((https://github.com/XueyiDong)

More information below! Event on [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-tunis/events/276066018).

We are delighted to get back to the R4Bioinfo series that we've launched in September 2020. We will be organizing a workshop which will cover the RNA-seq analysis.

The ability to easily and efficiently analyse RNA-sequencing data is a key strength of the Bioconductor project. Starting with counts summarised at the gene-level, a typical analysis involves pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, differential expression testing and pathway analysis with the results obtained informing future experiments and validation studies. In this workflow article, we analyse RNA-sequencing data from the mouse mammary gland, demonstrating use of the popular edgeR package to import, organise, filter and normalise the data, followed by the limma package with its voom method, linear modelling and empirical Bayes moderation to assess differential expression and perform gene set testing. This pipeline is further enhanced by the Glimma package which enables interactive exploration of the results so that individual samples and genes can be examined by the user. The complete analysis offered by these three packages highlights the ease with which researchers can turn the raw counts from an RNA-sequencing experiment into biological insights using Bioconductor (https://f1000research.com/articles/5-1408).

Date/Time : Februrary 6th, 2021 from 9:00 AM to 11:15 PM UTC

Place : Zoom https://zoom.us/download

# Trainer : Xueyi Dong

[Xueyi Dong](https://github.com/XueyiDong) is a PhD candidate at Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia. She loves to share her experiences with RNA-seq data analysis. Xueyi has translated the analysis workflow package [RNAseq123](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/workflows/html/RNAseq123.html) into Mandarin, and she has taught the workshop on different events using both English and Mandarin.
