<img src="/foundation/images/fulls/whyr2019/agenda.jpg" class="fit image"> A month ago we closed Call for Papers for Why R? 2019 Conference. Today we are pleased to announce the agenda!

From over 75 submissions (from 4 continents) we finally selected 46 presentations (divided into 12 sessions), 15 lightning talks and 9 workshops!! Abstracts are already available [here](https://github.com/WhyR2019/abstracts/).

To make the event even more interesting we invited 6 keynotes that will for sure give amazing plenary talks. Learn more about keynotes and proposed workshops in this post
