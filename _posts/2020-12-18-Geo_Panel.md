<img src="/foundation/images/fulls/whyr2020/panels/geo.jpg" class="fit image"> Three months ago we finished [Why R? 2020](http://2020.whyr.pl/) conference. The highlights of the conference were Discussion Panels! Today we would like to remind you about the Geospatial panel. The video from the recording is at the end of the post.

rspatial is one of the examples of prolific R communities coordinating the efforts to push the boundaries of spatial data analysis in R even further. The aim of this panel was to highlight not only recent efforts of rspatial, but also shed some light on the planned endeavors. [RogerBivan](https://twitter.com/RogerBivand), [Dewey Dunnington](https://twitter.com//paleolimbot), [Tomislav Hengl](https://twitter.com/tom_hengl), 
[Robin Lovelace](https://twitter.com/robinlovelace) and [Paula Morgana](https://twitter.com/Paula_Moraga_) talked about the most exciting among existing or forthcoming tools to analyze spatial data in R.
