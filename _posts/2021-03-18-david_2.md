### Talk

#### Speaker
- [David Gohel](https://twitter.com/DavidGohel)
  <br> David Gohel is the founder of ArData, a French company providing R expertise, R training and consulting in data 
  sciences. He is the author of R packages, most popular are _officer_, _flextable_, _rvg_ and _ggiraph_. He is a data 
  scientist and software engineer. His professional experiences led him to face many challenges related to the data of
  organizations, which he has always managed with solutions involving R software.

#### _officeverse_: Creating Word and PowerPoint documents with R
The officer package has been developed to facilitate the production of Word documents and PowerPoint presentations with 
R. The initial project was to offer an alternative solution to SAS ODS for tabular and graphical reports produced in 
Word for one of my clients. The range of functionalities has expanded, and some very interesting extensions have been 
created. There is the _officedown_ package that increases the layout capabilities of R Markdown when the output is Word,
the _rvg_ package to create editable vector graphics, the flextable package to make nice tables. In this presentation, 
you will see how to use the package to produce PowerPoint presentations and Word documents. Its role as a foundation for
other packages and new documentation will be discussed. It will also be an opportunity for David to present the 
_officedown_ package for the first time.
