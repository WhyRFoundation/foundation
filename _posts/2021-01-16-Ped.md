### Talk

#### Speaker

[Nujcharee Haswell](https://twitter.com/nujcharee)

Data & Intelligence Specialist / Data Scientist Apprentice from North Yorkshire County Council. I’ve used PowerBI to help with data analysis tasks since 2015. My background is in business intelligence development and applications of data science. I enjoy taking part in hackathons for social good. I live and work in North Yorkshire with my husband, my son and my dog called Chewie.


#### R in PowerBi - an introduction

PowerBI is a free business intelligence tool by Microsoft. With little codes (or sometimes no code at all), performing tasks such as connecting, cleaning, manipulating and visualising data can be pretty amazingly quick and easy. This introductory tutorial will walkthrough PowerBI workflow from connecting data using R script connector, visualising your analysis, sharing your result and finally operationalising your R script – all by using PowerBI as the authoring tool.
