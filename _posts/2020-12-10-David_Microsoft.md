### Talk description  

#### R at Microsoft
In 2015, Microsoft acquired the R-based software startup Revolution Analytics, which spurred Microsoft's investment in R and, ultimately, in open source generally. In this talk, David will review the history of R at Microsoft, and survey the landscape of Microsoft products than now integrate with R.
