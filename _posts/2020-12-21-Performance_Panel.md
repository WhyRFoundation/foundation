<img src="/foundation/images/fulls/whyr2020/panels/performance.jpg" class="fit image"> Three months ago we finished [Why R? 2020](http://2020.whyr.pl/) conference. The highlights of the conference were Discussion Panels! Today we would like to remind you about the Performance panel. The video from the recording is at the end of the post.

Is R a slow and memory-inefficient language or does this perception stem from improper usage? How can users avoid such limitations? The aim of this panel is to highlight some less-known performance problems and provide a unique insight into the internal workings of [Jan Vitek](https://twitter.com/j_v_66), [Kylie Ariel](https://twitter.com/kuwisdelu), [Tomas Kalibera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalibera/), [Norm Matloff](https://twitter.com/matloff) and [Luke Tierney](https://twitter.com/LukeTierney4) discussed various aspects of performance in R during this panel.
