  London Business School.

#### Analysing Political Speeches in R - some approaches
Legislative debate transcripts can provide unique insights into politics and policy. They can be used to identify 
popular topics among different legislators, reveal party factions that do not show up in voting behaviour, and longitudinal
changes in the language used to discuss certain topics, amongst other things. In this webinar I'll discuss some approaches
and potential pitfalls to analysing legislative debate, using the British House of Commons as an example.
