### Talk

#### Speaker
- [Roel Hogervorst](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rmhogervorst/)
  <br> He is a maker who loves to build useful (Machine Learning) tools for people, and sharing what he learns. Roel has
  been working as a researcher, data scientist and machine learning engineer for the past years. His aim is to make it 
  easy, convenient and simple for everyone to run their R work in the Cloud.
  <br> In life-away-from-the-screen, Roel also loves like dogs and him and his girlfriend are getting one soon!
 


#### Running your Rscript in the Cloud
Life as member of a data team is awesome but as a lone data scientist in a small company one might have to be a data 
engineer, IT consultant and data scientist all-in-one. How does one get R scripts to run?
<br> In this talk, Roel hopes to inspire lone data scientists on all the ways they can run R scripts using Cloud providers.
He will cover from simple to more advanced use-cases for running R in the Cloud. Finally, Roal will also discuss how to 
cooperate with IT departments for the most efficient results.
