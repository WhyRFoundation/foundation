### Why Hackathon?

Hackathons are events where enthusiasts of a specific topic gather in one place to work together on challenges that arose for a particular community.<br>

Hackathons tend to be timepressure events, where solutions need to be created quicky and  active cooperation between participants is necessary. To set the pace of the event, participants are divided into teams which compete to prepare the most valuable solution and win a prize. <br>

For a participant such an undertaking is a great chance to: <br>

<ul>
<li>develop the ability to work in group</li>
<li>learn from more experienced practitioners</li>
<li>take part in lectures related to data analysis</li>
<li>have a remarkable networking experience</li>
<li>participate in healthy and fair competition</li>
<li>test his/her skills in comparison with the others</li>
<li>win prizes</li>
<li>learn new presentation techniques</li>
<li><b>brainstorm new business use cases</b></li>
</ul>

### The challenge

> Academic papers are not cited by every researcher in proper format, for academic search engines it is problematic to find citations per each paper. As papers are cited in different formats, also with some typos, matching citations with the title of the papers is a complicated task. 

More to be added soon!

### Competition Rules

Since the event is a competition with symbolic prices, we would like to grade solutions.
Criterias will be shared soon!

### Mentors and Judges

To provide solutions of the highest quality we have invited data science experts that will be available during the event for mentoring. At the time of closing presentations mentors will become judges of solutions and will score them based on the competition rules.
