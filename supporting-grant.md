# Motivation

The aim of the Why R? Foundation is to reinforce the growth of data science in Poland by keeping it balanced and diverse. To do so, since 2018 Why R? Foundation is distributing the Why R? Supporting Grant for Woman in Data Science. The idea is not only to aid exceptional female data scientists but also to showcase them as role models to the whole community.    

# Awardees

## Sylwia Majchrowska

Sylwia completed master studies in mathematics at the University of Wrocław, as well as in physics at the Wrocław University of Science and Technology, where she continues her education towards the doctorate degree. Currently she investigates novel nonlinear optical phenomena that occur in multimode optical fibers by developing numerical tools to identify the impact of several modeling approximations for typical experimental parameters.

In her professional career, she is designing and developing deep learning algorithms for image processing using neural network models. She was a member of a team working on developing a method to automate the analysis of bacterial colonies on Petri dishes using artificial neural networks and machine learning algorithms, in particular, to classify the type of bacteria and to determine the number of colonies.

She is also a mentor in many volunteering programs, in which she teaches programming and tech knowledge at schools to increase interest in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) area among children.

## Alicja Gosiewska (2018)

Alicja Gosiewska is a PhD student in Computer Science, keen on machine learning and its applications. She is interested in Interpretable Machine Learning (IML), Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), auditability of predictive models, and bioinformatics.

Packages are bread-and-butter of R, a vital tool that allows R enthusiasts to exchange their creations in an easy and accessible way. Although packages are so useful, their development is always associated with a lot of challenges, including huge time investments. Alicja received the grant for her achievements in the development of the [auditor](https://github.com/MI2DataLab/auditor) package.
