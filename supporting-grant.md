## Alicja Gosiewska (2018)

Alicja Gosiewska is a PhD student in Computer Science, keen on machine learning and its applications. She is interested in Interpretable Machine Learning (IML), Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), auditability of predictive models, and bioinformatics.

Packages are bread-and-butter of R, a vital tool that allows R enthusiasts to exchange their creations in an easy and accessible way. Although packages are so useful, their development is always associated with a lot of challenges, including huge time investments.
