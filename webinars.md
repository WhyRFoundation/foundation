# The first talk

<img src="/foundation/images/fulls/webinars/achim.jpg" class="fit image">

We had a pleasure to host [Achim Zeileis from Universit√§t Innsbruck](https://eeecon.uibk.ac.at/~zeileis/) as a kick-off speaker.
The topic of the webinar was **R/exams: A One-for-All Exams Generator - Online Tests, Live Quizzes, and Written Exams with R** 
which was a very good suite for teachers facing the need of the remote R teaching!

Speaker's biogram and the abstract of the talk was available [on a meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/Spotkania-Entuzjastow-R-Warsaw-R-Users-Group-Meetup/events/269589118/) and on [the webinar url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnyCR7q4P4Q) that is also visible from [youtube.com/c/WhyRFoundation](https://www.youtube.com/c/WhyRFoundation) YouTube channel.

Performance [of the talk](https://youtube.com/watch?v=PnyCR7q4P4Q)
- We had over 200 unique participants over the course of this webinar, 
- with more than 100 participants during the whole event.
- After a week we observed 800 views of the talk.
