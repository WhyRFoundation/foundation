Hey! This is the template for a pull request <- you can delete this line when providing a pull request.


The most probable reason for your pull request is the fact that you are about to create a new blog post about whyr webinars.
Please make sure that your pull request satisfies the below list

- [ ] The date of the blog post is at least 5 hours younger then the time of a potential merge. E.g. if you are providing a PR on 2021-02-13 11:00pm CET, and probably the review will be done
2021-02-14 10:00am CET then please provide the +5hours time in your blog post, which in this case would be 2021-02-14 3:00pm CET. The timeline needs to be bigger in the blog post, so it populates in the main thread on R-bloggers.
- [ ] Please ensure the repository that you are making a PR from is up to date. We recommend to make a pull on your repository so that you work on the latest version of the repository.
- [ ] Please make sure that the !iframe URL! to youtube video is of this format https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID
