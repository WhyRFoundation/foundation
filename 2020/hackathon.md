### Why text mining?

Text mining is widely known within machine wandering practitioners. The increased interest in the text mining is caused by an augmentation of internet users and by rapid growth of the internet data which is said that in a great amount is a text data. Extracting information from articles, news, posts and comments have became a desirable skill but what is even more needful are tools for text mining models diagnostics and visualizations.

Even though there are a lot of tools, books and webinars available online there is still a place for the improvement and development.

### Why Hackathon?

Hackathons are events where enthusiasts of a specific topic gather in one place to work together on challenges that arose for a particular community.<br>

Hackathons tend to be timepressure events, where solutions need to be created quicky and  active cooperation between participants is necessary. To set the pace of the event, participants are divided into teams which compete to prepare the most valuable solution and win a prize. <br>

For a participant such an undertaking is a great chance to: <br>

<ul>
<li>develop the ability to work in group</li>
<li>learn from more experienced practitioners</li>
<li>take part in lectures and workshops related to text mining</li>
<li>have a remarkable networking experience</li>
<li>participate in healthy and fair competition</li>
<li>test skills in comparison with the others</li>
<li>win prizes</li>
<li>learn new data analysis techniques</li>
<li>use new tools</li>
<li><b>brainstorm new business use cases</b></li>
</ul>

### Challenges

There will be multiple challenges that you can participate in. Each team can send a solution for each of the challenges.

> To be announced at the opening!

### Competition Rules

Since the event is a competition with symbolic prices, we would like to grade solutions. 
Solutions should be sent as videos (max 5 min! per video). They should be presenting insights developed to solve stated challenges.
Each team can send a solution for each challenge in as a separate video (one video for one challenge). 
More details about hackathon criterias announced at the event opening!
